## oh my god
I have to say it's difficult for me.
I think it when i am eating or warking and it costs me a lot of time. 
And I still cannot deal with it.
At last,i ask somebody for answer.
here is it 
`
int maxSubArray(int* nums, int numsSize) {
    int i=0;
	int sum=0;
	int max=0;
	int allsum=0;
	int maxnum=nums[0];
	for(i=0; i<numsSize; i++) {
		sum+=nums[i];
		maxnum=maxnum>nums[i]?maxnum:nums[i];
		if(sum>max)
			max=sum;
		else if(sum<0)
			sum=0;
	}
	max=maxnum>0?max:maxnum;
	return max;
}
`

ok it's time to google the way how to use markdown in github
