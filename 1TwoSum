maybe this is the first question of leetcode


`
public int[] TwoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] arr=new int[2];
        for(int i=0;i<nums.Count();i++)
        {
            for(int j=nums.Count()-1;j>i;j--)
            {
                if((nums[i]+nums[j])==target)
                {
                    arr[0]=i;
                    arr[1]=j;
                    return arr;
                }
            }
        }
        return arr;
    }
`

O(N^2) maybe this is a failure methold
I cannot understand why they could dell with it in O(1) 
It's like black magic.
